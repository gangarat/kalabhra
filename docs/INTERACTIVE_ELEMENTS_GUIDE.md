## Usage Examples

### Creating Interactive Elements

```gdscript
# Create a manuscript element
var manuscript_id = InteractiveElements.create_manuscript_element({
    "position": Vector3(5, 1, 3),
    "manuscript_type": "prayer_scroll",
    "language": "middle_persian",
    "script": "manichaean",
    "educational_level": "intermediate",
    "cultural_context": "manichaean_daily_practice",
    "preservation_state": "good"
})

# Create an artifact element
var artifact_id = InteractiveElements.create_artifact_element({
    "position": Vector3(-2, 1, 0),
    "artifact_type": "ceremonial_lamp",
    "material": "bronze",
    "time_period": "sassanid_era",
    "cultural_origin": "persian",
    "religious_significance": "manichaean_light_symbolism"
})

# Create an architectural feature
var arch_id = InteractiveElements.create_architectural_element({
    "position": Vector3(0, 0, 10),
    "feature_type": "persian_arch",
    "architectural_style": "sassanid",
    "construction_period": "6th_century",
    "symbolic_meaning": "divine_ascension"
})
```

### Managing Interactions

```gdscript
# Start interaction with an element
var success = InteractiveElements.start_element_interaction(
    element_id,
    player_id,
    InteractiveElements.InteractionMode.EDUCATIONAL_STUDY
)

# Reveal progressive content levels
InteractiveElements.reveal_content_level(session_id, InteractiveElements.ContentLevel.CULTURAL_CONTEXT)
InteractiveElements.reveal_content_level(session_id, InteractiveElements.ContentLevel.HISTORICAL_SIGNIFICANCE)

# Complete interaction and get learning data
var learning_data = InteractiveElements.complete_interaction(session_id)
```

### Educational Integration

```gdscript
# Check knowledge requirements for advanced content
var can_access = InteractiveElements.check_knowledge_requirements(
    element_id,
    player_id,
    InteractiveElements.ContentLevel.SCHOLARLY_ANALYSIS
)

# Unlock content based on player knowledge
InteractiveElements.unlock_advanced_content(element_id, player_id, "manichaean_theology")

# Record learning achievements
InteractiveElements.record_learning_achievement(
    element_id,
    player_id,
    "script_recognition_mastery",
    assessment_data
)
```
